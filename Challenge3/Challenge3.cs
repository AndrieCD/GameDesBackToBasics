Challenge 3: Player Health System

Concepts Practiced:
    Variables and conditionals
    Loops
    Functions with parameters and return values
    Input handling with Console.ReadLine()

Scenario:
    Simulate a basic player health manager, where the player can take damage or heal through user input.

Instructions:
    Start with health = 100 and maxHealth = 100.
    Create two methods:
        TakeDamage(int amount)
        Heal(int amount)

Let the player choose each turn whether to take damage or heal.
Prevent health from dropping below 0 or going above maxHealth.


Example Output:
    === Player Health Manager ===
    Current Health: 100

    Choose an action:
    1. Take Damage
    2. Heal
    > 1
    Player takes 15 damage. Current Health: 85

    Choose an action:
    > 2
    Player heals 30 HP. Current Health: 100

    Choose an action:
    > 1
    Player takes 200 damage. Current Health: 0

    Player has been defeated!
