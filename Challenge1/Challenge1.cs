Challenge 1: Stat Calculator with Mixed Data Types and Casting

Concepts:
Data types, explicit/implicit casting, arithmetic operations, console input, input validation, type conversion

Scenario:
    Simulate a simplified RPG stat system where a player’s Power Level is calculated using stats of different data types.
    You’ll need to perform explicit and implicit casts to ensure the computation works correctly.

Instructions:
    - Declare the following variables:
        Strength as int (1-10)
        Agility as short (1-5)
        CriticalRate as float (0.0 - 1.0)
        Power as byte
    - Ask the user to input each stat, exluding Power.
    - If input is out of range, show an error and terminate.
    - Compute power by adding Strength, Agility, and CriticalRate together.
    - Display all entered stats.
    - Display Power as float, int, and byte.
    - Allow the user to repeat the calculation or exit.

Example Output:
    == RPG Stat Calculator ==
    Enter Strength (1-10): 8
    Enter Agility (1-5): 4
    Enter Critical Rate (0.0 - 1.0): 0.25
    Power Calculation:
        Strength: 8
        Agility: 4
        Critical Rate: 0.25 
        Power (float): 12.25
        Power (int): 12
        Power (byte): 12
